In Mongoose, aggregation refers to the process of performing a series of operations on a collection of documents, and then returning the computed results. It
Aggregation in Mongoose is done using the aggregate() function, which takes an array of pipeline stages as its argument. 
Each stage in the pipeline represents a transformation that is applied to the input documents, and the output of one stage becomes the input of the next stage.

db.collection.aggregate([
    <stage1>,
    <stage2>,
    .
    .
    .
    <stageN>
])

Each stage start form stage operator
{ $<stageOperator> : { } }
Example : 
{ $match : { age : { $gt : 20 } } }

Aggregation stages :
$match
$group
$project
$sort
$count
$limit
$skip
$out
